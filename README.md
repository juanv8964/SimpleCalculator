# Simple Calculator (Java Console App)
> A feature rich Java console calculator with memory, file saving, and precision control.

A fully functional Java console-based calculator that performs basic, advanced, and memory operations through a structured, menu-driven interface.
This project was developed as part of a multi-day coding series to strengthen skills in clean code, modular design, exception handling, and file management in Java.

## Features
- **Basic Operations:** Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide  
- **Advanced Operations:** Power, Modulus, Square Root, Absolute Value  
- **Memory System:** Store, Recall, and Clear results (M+, MR, MC)  
- **History Tracking:**
  - View, Clear, and Save session history  
  - Persistent storage in `history.txt`
  - Auto-loads history at startup  
- **Settings:**
  - Change decimal precision (0â€“4 places)
  - Displays dynamic status line (Memory, History Count, Precision)
- **Session Summary:**
  - Total operations performed  
  - Invalid inputs counted  
  - Memory status  
  - Session duration
  ## Technologies Used
- **Language:** Java  
- **Concepts Covered:**
  - Loops and switch statements
  - Methods and modular design
  - Exception handling (`try-catch`)
  - Input validation with `Scanner`
  - File I/O (`FileWriter`, `BufferedReader`)
  - Data persistence with `ArrayList`
  - Session tracking using `System.currentTimeMillis()`
## How to Run
1. Clone or download the project:
   ```bash
   ```git clone https://github.com/juanv8964/SimpleCalculator.git```
**Compile the code:**
   ```javac simpleCalculator.java```
   ```java simpleCalculator```
   ## Future Improvements
- Add scientific functions (sin, cos, tan, log)
- Build a GUI version using Java Swing
- Add CSV or PDF export for saved history
- Create a Spring Boot web version
